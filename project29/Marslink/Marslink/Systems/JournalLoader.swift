The hydrogen and oxygen combine to make water. If I throttle the reaction I can let this run all day and generate enough water in the air to hydrate my potatos.\n\nThough, I'm basically igniting jet fuel in my living room.",

Where I'm making mini explosions. Oh did I mention I live here?\n\nI survived but the HAB is basically gone, along with all my potatos. The cold air instantly froze the ones I have, so there's that at least.",

The little rover only lasted a couple months, but I found it! All I had to do was swap the batteries and its as good as new.\n\nWith all this in place I can send pictures to NASA, maybe Johansen can tell me how to hack this thing?",
